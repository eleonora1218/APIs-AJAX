How Web Works Exercise


Part One: Solidify Terminology

What is HTTP?
HyperText Transfer "Protocol" used for exchanging webpage data. Specifically the protocol governs how a user gets data from and to a server

What is a URL?
Uniform Resource Locator. Web-bar address of a webpage, not to be confused with an IP address

What is DNS?
The Domain "Name[ing] System" used to identify computers reachable through the Internet through appropriate IP addresses and readable domain names. Specifically it converts URLs to IPs

What is a query string?
q = "string of what you would like to search" added to a URL manually or when using a search bar provided on a webpage

What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
GET: Retrieves from the internet/server
POST: Adds/changes content to webpages/server

What is an HTTP request?
A request for content from a server

What is an HTTP response?
The internet or webpage responds by providing content after a request has been made. 

What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
*************
Headers provide additional information about the request or the response. Here are some examples:
Request headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, Cache-Control
Response headers: Content-Type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control
*************

What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
*************
1. Your browser “resolves” the name into an IP address using DNS
2. Your browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers (info about browser, any previous cookies, and other things)
3. The server sends a response (typically, HTML, with a status code (200 if it was sucessful)
4. The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc)
5. The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each

Part Two: Practice Tools

1. Using curl, make a GET request to the icanhazdadjoke.com API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”
terminal: curl -H "Accept: text/plain" "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=pirate"  

2. Use dig to find what the IP address is for icanhazdadjoke.com
dig icanhazdadjoke.com

3. Make a simple web page and serve it using python3 -m http.server. Visit the page in a browser.
code .
python3 -m http.server
http://localhost:8000/



Part Three: Explore Dev Tools

Build a very simple HTML form that uses the GET method (it can use the same page URL for the action) when the form is submitted. Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it, explore in Chrome Developer tools how you can view the request and response headers. Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the browser and re-submit. Do you still see the field in the query string? Explore in Chrome how you can view the request and response headers, as well as the form data.

    <form method="get">
        <label for="query">What do you need help with?</label>
        <input type="text" placeholder="Type here" name="query">
        <button>Submit</button>
    </form>

    http://127.0.0.1:5500/?query=everything
**query key word can by anything but it needs to match inside input & label



Part Four: Explore the URL API
